Support for ckeditor:

+ new page (just clears the editable)
- templates (should re-init the editable)
+ copy/paste
- undo (works, but not as intended)
+ find/replace/select-all
- spellchecker; don't know how to get it to work, not a wikidocs issue
- form; should we whitelist forms? what are the security implications?
+ form elements; input/select/textarea etc. all are whitelisted,
  but the state or their text content is not an attribute but a property,
  and properties are not synced; only if you bind a text input or a textarea
  are they synced (should support that for checkboxes etc. as well).

+ bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, subscript, superscript, remove-format
+ inser/remove/indent/outdent numbered/bulleted list
+ block quote
= create div container
= align left/center/right/justifiy
+ text-direction left/right, set language

Links:
+ URL(http,https,news,ftp)/email links/unlinking
- anchors (and links to anchors); would need transformations and maybe editable re-init
- these attributes on the third link tab aren't whitelisted due to security
  considerations (should we whitelist them?):
  accesskey, charset, rel (relationship), type (content-type), tabindex, style
- frame targets aren't whitelisted due to security considerations.

= images except for non-whitelisted target attribute
- flash (didn't try it out yet)
= tables
+ horizontal line
- page break (contentEditable attribute not whitelisted, should we?
  also, needs some initialization to work correctly)
- iframe (not whitelisted, should we?)

= block/inline styles
+ block formats (h1,h2,...) 
= font name/size, foreground/background color
+ show blocks
